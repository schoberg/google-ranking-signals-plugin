# Signal Gap Analysis — Competitive Comparison Framework

Framework for comparing a target page against ranking competitors by signal category. Identifies which signals competitors leverage that the target page lacks.

## Step 1: Identify the Competitive Set

For the target query, identify the top 3-5 ranking pages. For each competitor, note:

- URL and domain
- Domain age and authority level
- Content type and format
- Author information
- Publish/update date

## Step 2: Signal-by-Signal Comparison

### NavBoost Signals

| Signal | Target Page | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Title compelling for CTR | | | | |
| Content satisfies intent fully | | | | |
| Page loads fast | | | | |
| Low pogo-sticking risk | | | | |

**Gap identified:** _[Note where competitors have clear advantages in click-worthiness]_

### Site Authority

| Signal | Target Page | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Domain age | | | | |
| Brand recognition | | | | |
| Site-wide quality | | | | |
| Knowledge Graph presence | | | | |

**Gap identified:** _[Note authority differences that may require long-term strategy]_

### Content Quality

| Signal | Target Page | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Content depth/word count | | | | |
| Unique insights/data | | | | |
| Freshness (last updated) | | | | |
| Vocabulary diversity | | | | |
| Title-query alignment | | | | |
| Multimedia (images, video) | | | | |

**Gap identified:** _[Note specific content dimensions where competitors excel]_

### Author & Entity

| Signal | Target Page | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Named expert author | | | | |
| Author credentials visible | | | | |
| E-E-A-T evidence | | | | |
| Schema markup | | | | |

**Gap identified:** _[Note author/entity advantages competitors have]_

### Link Profile

| Signal | Target Page | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Referring domain count | | | | |
| High-quality source links | | | | |
| Link diversity | | | | |
| Recent link acquisition | | | | |

**Gap identified:** _[Note link profile differences]_

### UX & Engagement

| Signal | Target Page | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core Web Vitals pass | | | | |
| Mobile experience quality | | | | |
| Content scannability | | | | |
| Session depth potential | | | | |

**Gap identified:** _[Note UX advantages competitors have]_

## Step 3: Gap Prioritization

Rank identified gaps by impact and addressability:

### Critical Gaps (likely blocking rankings)
_Gaps in Critical or High-impact signal categories where competitors are significantly stronger._

1. _[Gap description]_ — Category: _[signal category]_ — Fix: _[action]_
2. _[Gap description]_ — Category: _[signal category]_ — Fix: _[action]_

### Significant Gaps (limiting ranking potential)
_Gaps in Medium-impact categories or moderate differences in High-impact categories._

1. _[Gap description]_ — Category: _[signal category]_ — Fix: _[action]_
2. _[Gap description]_ — Category: _[signal category]_ — Fix: _[action]_

### Minor Gaps (optimization opportunities)
_Small differences that could provide incremental gains._

1. _[Gap description]_ — Category: _[signal category]_ — Fix: _[action]_

## Step 4: Strategic Recommendations

### Where to Compete

Identify signal categories where the gap is smallest or most addressable. Focus resources where improvement is feasible and impactful.

### Where to Differentiate

Identify signal categories where the target page could surpass competitors:
- Original research or data competitors don't have
- Superior author credentials or E-E-A-T evidence
- Better UX or technical implementation
- Stronger freshness or update cadence
- Unique content format or depth

### Where to Accept Limitations

Some gaps (domain age, long-established authority) require years to close. Acknowledge these and focus effort elsewhere.
